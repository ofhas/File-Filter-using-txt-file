# File-Filter-using-txt-file

Just a simple GUI app that lists all of user input file type that exists in a given folder.\
For example if we want to list of all .jpg files in a folder we'll input the file type and browse the folder location and out the number of files of that type and a txt file that holds all of the files from that type\
